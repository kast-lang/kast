State\nThis page briefly describes some ideas of the language.\nThe current work is focused on getting a proof of concept implementation of the described features.\nThe language is not usable yet.\nPowerful\nWhile a language being easy to learn is a nice thing to have,\nit should not be done at the cost of missing features.\nBeing a beginner is only temporary,\nand thus being beginner friendly is not a priority for Kast.\nAt the same time, if something can be made simpler without sacrificing power,\nit should be made simpler.\nReliable\nKast is focusing more on program's ease of maintenance\ninstead of focusing on the speed of prototyping.\nThe goal is to eliminate as many classes of bugs at compile-time as possible.\nMinimal but General\nKast is designed to have a minimal set of core features,\nwhich can be composed into more complex ones easily.\nIf a feature can be broken down into simpler ones, it should not be in the core.\nFor example, while the core of the language is purely functional,\nwe can still have familiar for loops, returns from functions,\nchecked exceptions from other languages implemented as library features:\n\nThis works as a combination of core features like:\n\nfirst-class functions\nfunction contexts\nsum types\nunwinding\n\nAnother example of composable feature is async/await,\nwhich also needs delimited continuations in addition to the above\nCompiled or interpreted\nKast is an interpreter with compiler implemented as a library.\nThe interpreter still has the \"compilation\" process,\nwhich is \"compiling\" the code into IR.\nDuring that \"compilation\" interpreting might still be triggered\nif something needs to be known at \"comptime\".\nBy having first-class IR (intermetiate representation as value)\nyou can write a function that coverts it into the desired target:\n\nPerformance\nThe IR should have enough information for the compiler to produce performant code.\nFor example, compilation target is not required to have a garbage collector.\nThose references that can be checked at compile time, are checked.\nIf you need recursive data structures (for example construct mutually recursive closures),\nthen they must be explicitly marked as such:\n\nIn this case, both f and g are going to be freed as soon as the arena object itself needs to be.\nIn there are still references to them when arena is dropped,\nthe borrow checker is going to result in compilation error.\nIn addition to compile checked borrows,\ncell types / reference counting / garbage collector are implementable as a library\nType system\nKast is a strongly typed language.\nSum types\naka discriminated union / algebraic data type:\n\nCasting\nIn Kast you can define casting rules:\n\nBy defining casting rules for types we can get trait/typeclass/interfaces:\n\nHere, trait can either be a concrete type, or a template.\nIn the latter case, the value for which casting is being defined becomes the argument of the template.\nThis allows you to refer to Self in trait definition, or implement traits for a pair of types\n(multi-parameter typeclasses) easily.\n\nTuples\nTuples in Kast can have both named and unnamed fields:\n\nVariadic length tuples:\n\nVariadic tuples allow for variadic generics easily:\n\nType inference\nKast implements an inference algorithm based on the Hindley–Milner approach,\nwhich allows most of types in the program to be inferred.\nFunction contexts\nNot every function in Kast can just be called whenever.\nFunctions can specify contexts that must be in scope when calling them.\nContexts can be of any type:\n\nThis function specifies that a allocator must be present when calling it.\nIn a way, function contexts act like implicit arguments (but implemented differently).\nIn order to bring a context into scope, use with:\n\noverflows\n\nUnwinding\nWe can declare named blocks that we can return to without executing the rest of the body:\n\nunwindable_block creates the block and takes a function of type unwind_token -&gt; T\nand executes it immediately with the token of that block.\nWhen unwind :: (.token :: unwind_token, .value :: T) function is used from within,\nit stops executing current function and unwinds the stack until we return to the block.\nThe value of the block if either the result of executing the function (if unwind was not called),\nor the value given to the unwind.\nDelimited continuations\nSimilar to unwind, but allow you to resume execution after unwinding by creating the continuation object\nSyntax\nKast's syntax is not static, but dynamic.\nThe programmer can define their own syntax easily.\nThe default syntax is declared in std and can be not used if you wish.\nThe only builtin syntax is the syntax for defining new syntax:\n\nThis defines left associative (&lt;-) syntax for ternary operator with priority of 10.\nWhen Kast sees this in the source code, its being transformed into an AST:\n\nWhen compilation happes, the compiler is trying to find\na matching macro for the name given (ternary in this case),\nwhich is being invoked and evaluated into a new ast\nwhich is then processed recursively until some builtin macro converts it into IR\nMacros in Kast are just like normal functions:\n\nHere, we use a quote operator (`) to construct the resulting ast\nusing already existing syntax.\nThe unquote operator ($) is replacing the following ident with the ast\nthat was passed to the macro as argument.\n","id":"https://kast-lang.org/","title":"Juice"},"https://kast-lang.org/blog/":{"body":"","id":"https://kast-lang.org/blog/","title":"Blog"},"https://kast-lang.org/blog/ast/":{"body":"In Kast there is no builtin syntax. Except for syntax for adding new syntax.\nThe standard syntax is defined in std/syntax.ks, but you can ignore it and define your own instead.\nWhen parsing code into AST, Kast treats everything as an expression,\nand every syntax definition is extending what an expression can be.\nFor example, you could define a ternary if like in Python like so:\n\nThis defines syntax for ternary-if (which should be defined somewhere)\nwhich is right associative (-&gt;), has priority (precedence) of 20,\nand is defined as true_value \"if\" condition \"else\" false_value where\ntrue_value, condition and false_value can be anything defined by\nother syntax rules with higher priority (or be a simple single-token value),\nand the if and else are \"keywords\".\nKeywords can also be punctuation, so a ternary operator from C could be defined as:\n\n\nThe AST parsing algorithm takes a sequence of tokens and a collection of syntax definitions stored in such data structure and constructs an AST.\nAn example of parsed AST for a if b else c ? d : e:\n\nOverview\nThe algorithm starts by trying to parse a smallest\ncomplete expression starting at the beginning.\nFor example, it would parse just a from a + b + c,\nor it would parse (a + b) from (a + b) + c + d.\nAfter that, it tries to expand the first expression by making it a part of a more complex expression, finding the next smallest one.\nFor example a from a + b + c would be expanded to a + b,\nand (a + b) from (a + b) + c + d would be expanded to (a + b) + c.\nThen it tries to expand it again and again until it can make no more progress.\nThe first step is basically same as expanding from nothing, so what we do is this:\n\n\nSo, a single expand operation is trying to parse either a simple (single-token) value,\nor a single syntax definition.\nIn order to do so, we store all the syntax definitions in a helper data structure.\nStoring syntax definitions\nSyntax definitions are stored in a trie -\na tree data structure, where each node represents partially parsed syntax definition.\nAn edge from parent to a child in this tree represents making progress,\nwhich is either following a keyword, or parsing an inner value.\nSome nodes are terminal, meaning that they represent fully parsed syntax definition.\nFor example, for storing ternary-if definition like above\nthere would be a path from the root of the tree following edges:\n\nvalue\nif keyword\nvalue\nelse keyword\nvalue\n\nThe final node after following this path is marked as terminal,\ncorresponding to the ternary-if definition.\nIf, in addition to this syntax we also had a similar syntax definition but without the else case\n(syntax just-if -&gt; 20 = true_value \"if\" condition),\nand lets say a binary + operator (defined as syntax plus &lt;- 30 = a \"+\" b),\nthen we would have a tree like this:\n\n\nActually, since we need to expand either starting with an already_parsed value or with nothing,\nwe store two roots - one starting without a value and one with,\ninstead of having a value edge from the root.\nParsing single definition\nSo, in order to parse a single syntax definition we need to traverse this tree to some terminal node.\nWe try to make as much progress as we can in a loop.\nIn every iteration, we first see if the token ahead is a keyword that we can follow with.\nIf not, and if there exists a value edge from the current node, then we\ntry to parse a value by recursively calling into parse_expr.\nIf it succeeded to parse something, then we follow the value edge.\nIn other cases we stop and check that we arrived in a terminal node.\nIf not, then the code has a syntax error.\nWhen parsing inner values it is also important to take\npriorities and associativities of syntax definitions into consideration.\nThis means that both parse_expr and expand actually are also taking extra argument\nwhich is the binding power (priority + associativity) of the outer expression, if there is one.\nThe only exception is if we are parsing an inner value inside parentheses\n(like if we are parsing \"(\" expr \")\" syntax definition).\nIn such case, inner values are parsed just like the top level expression.\nThis also means that binding power is stored in the syntax trie in every node (other than root),\nand when making progress we check that if we should actually proceed or not.\nHere's an incomplete implementation:\n\nThere are more missing details in this implementation.\nFor example, if there is a syntax definition which contains a keyword\nwhich is also used in the beginning of another definition,\nthen we shouldn't start parsing a new one while in the process of parsing another.\nFor example, if we had these definitions:\n\nIn this case, when parsing condition of the if we should treat the \"(\" as continuation of the if, not as start of the second argument of call with condition being the first.\n","id":"https://kast-lang.org/blog/ast/","title":"Kast's AST parser"}},"docInfo":{"https://kast-lang.org/":{"body":480,"title":1},"https://kast-lang.org/blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://kast-lang.org/blog/ast/":{"body":412,"title":3}},"length":3},"lang":"English"}
